                        Enterprises have bought endless productivity solutions, to try and get a better competitive edge, ease the need to have specialized expertise, democratize access and make better decisions.

                         While productivity solutions have somewhat allowed for better access to information compared to paper documentation, they have dramatically increased the amount of expertise required for useful operation. Forcing users to adapt to them instead of adapting around the user.

                            Users demand a greater ability to work on their terms. Organizations which offer solutions that adapt around the user will be able to attract, retain and grow with their customers, suppliers and employees over their peers in their industry.

                            SKAEL’s Digital Employees purposely do not add any more tools, adapting completely around the user’s prefered communication method.
